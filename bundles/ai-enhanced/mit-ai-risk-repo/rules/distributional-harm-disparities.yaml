    Analyze this AI system for distributional harm disparities as defined in MIT AI Risk Repository.

    Code to analyze:
    ```{language}
    {code_snippet}
    ```

    File: {file_path}
    Context: {heuristic_findings}

    Evaluate for distributional risks where AI systems create or amplify harms that are unevenly distributed across different demographic groups, socioeconomic classes, or geographic regions:

    1. **Demographic Bias**: Does the system have different performance/error rates across demographic groups?
    2. **Access Inequality**: Does the system create barriers for disadvantaged groups?
    3. **Economic Impact**: Are economic harms disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations?
    4. **Geographic Disparities**: Does the system work differently across geographic regions?

    Consider MIT AI Risk categories:
    - Unequal access to beneficial AI applications
    - Disproportionate negative impacts on marginalized communities
    - Amplification of existing social inequalities
    - Geographic disparities in AI system performance

    Provide analysis with specific evidence of distributional harms.
